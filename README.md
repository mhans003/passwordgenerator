## Description 

This Node.js application runs an algorithm that outputs a randomly generated password to the user. 

The user is asked for two preferences (password length and character type), and the program utilizes unique character codes corresponding to the user's choices to randomly generate a new secure password upon each iteration. 

The program ensures that at least one of a user's selected character types will appear in the generated password.
